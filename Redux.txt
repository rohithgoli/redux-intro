Redux Store:
+ One store for the entire application
+ Responsibilities are:
    > Holds application state
    > Allows access to state via getState()
    > Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
    > Registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
    > Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscriber(listener)


+ It is good to maintain multiple reducers for handling different scenarios(cakes, ice-creams, etc..)
+ Also it is good to maintain separate state
+ Redux provide combineReducers to combine multiple reducers
